#Function for finding fibonacci series of 'n' terms is defined
    #Function is named as "fibonacci" and returns the fibonacci series of a number
    #Function accepts one integer parameter for which fibonacci series is to be found

    #First 2 terms of any fibonacci series by default is '0' and '1'
    terms = [0,1]
